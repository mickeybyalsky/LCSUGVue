                      This is Calculus II - which is entirely about integrals. If you found calculus I to be easy, don't think that this course is anything like it. There is an insane ramp
                      in difficulty between these two courses and a lot of difficult content. I recommend you pay a lot of attention and follow the textbook closely.

                      You need to take 6.00 credits in sciences from a list of courses. Typically this means either two biology, two chemistry, one biology and one chemistry,
                      or one physics course (biology and chemistry courses are 3.00 credits while physics is a 6.00 credit).<br><br>
                      I went with two chemistries (CHEM1000, CHEM1001) since I excelled in it in high school. Play to your strengths and what you did well in during high school.</p><br>

                      You need 90 credits for the regular degree, and 120 credits for the honours. The computer science, science, and mathematics requirement don't fill it completely, so you'll be taking
                      electives here and there.<br><br>
                      You can view taking electives in your first year in one of two ways: since first year courses are the easiest, this would be a great opportunity to take a few
                      electives alongside them. On the otherhand, if you are unsure how you'd fair in university and just want to gauge your performance, don't worry about taking any.</p><br>
                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - personally, I advise against taking an elective in your first year since you should use it to gauge how difficult you find university and to set good habits,
                      but some electives I've taken are MODR1770, GEOG2030, and STS2411. If you feel comfortable, take an elective or two since first year courses <i>are</i> the easiest.</p>

                      This course is intense on computing theory, and includes topics like automata theory, Turing machines, formal languages, and more. If these words don't make sense to
                      you, it didn't make sense to me either. This is really abstract and a theory heavy course, and I found this to be my least favourite second year course. It did have
                      its moments when it was really interesting, but it was also mostly hard and perplexing. Definitely urge you to pay attention in your lectures.</p><br>
                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - the most abstract and theory heavy course in second year. Listen in class, or you'll spiral further down this hill of constantly being behind.</p>

                    <p class="coursetext">
                      Arguably the <strong>most important second year course</strong> alongside EECS2030. It's important to master data structures because these concepts, alongside
                      algorithms, is usually the area you are tested on in your programming interviews. I definitely got carefree the first time I took this course and ended with a D, but I took
                      it again and got an A. Easy beginning, but definitely ramps up once you start trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms.</p><br>
                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - take this course seriously! Make sure you really, really, REALLY learn these concepts to a tee. Even after this course, keep practising and practising your
                      data structures. Go on HackerRank or LeetCode, and keep learning and refining your skills.</p>

                    <p class="coursetext">
                      Definitely a really unique course. While most people find this course annoying and useless, I actually found it interesting. You'll be learning about computer
                      architecture, and working with low-level assembly languages like RISC-V and Verilog. I still haven't used RISC-V or Verilog a day in my life since I took this course,
                      but it was still interesting to me nonetheless. Definitely has a heavy workload though, for sure.<br><br>
                      It's important to note that this is a <strong>4.00 credit</strong> course, so it weighs more heavily on your GPA than a 3.00 credit course would. If you're looking for an
                      opportunity to raise your GPA a bit, getting an A / A+ in this course would help.</p><br>
                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - can't say I've found much practical use for this course in my life, but if you want to go into low-level programming work or engineering roles, maybe
                      this would help you more if you knew these languages well. Heavy workload, don't recommend taking this alongside EECS2011.</p>

                      I consider two courses to be the fundamentals of second year: which is EECS2011, and this course, EECS2030. This is a Java course that goes into a lot of depth about Object-Oriented Programming.
                      The reason why I stress this is an important course is because this will ultimately help you to write better code as a developer. Plus, you'll be asked about OOP concepts in interviews.<br><br>
                      I enjoyed this course a lot, and it has a relatively lighter workload compared to other second year courses.</p><br>
                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - important and fundamental course with a relatively light workload. Despite this, spend ample amount of time learning the concepts.</p>

                      Your first C course. I found this one to be a little challenging because I was so used to languages like Java and Python, and C was like new territory for me. You will spend a lot of time
                      learning C, but also how to use a bunch of Linux commands, Bash scripting, and more.<br><br>
                      Have you been using Windows or Mac your whole time to program? Well now you'll be programming in an environment called Linux. Have you gotten used to hitting "run" in Android Studio or Eclipse
                      when programming in Java? Well now you'll learn how to compile and run C programs in a terminal!</p><br>

                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - in my opinion a challenging course, but to others an easy one. Can't give a solid statement on this, but learn C ahead of time if you're worried about this class.</p>

                      The follow-up to EECS1019. I found this course to be a lot easier. It's still a lot of logic, but less on the mathematical side in terms of number theory, counting principles, set theory,
                      etcetera. It's more abstract, logical concepts instead and with a lot more proofs.</p><br>

                      This course is about ethics in computer science. You'll be doing a lot of article readings and writing essays in this one - no coding whatsoever. When I took this, there was six short papers
                      and two longer essays. The exam for this class is <strong>brutal</strong>.<br><br>
                      I didn't really like this course too much because I'm not the best writer, and it felt a little subjective. I couldn't really tell what constitutes a good essay and I kept getting 60-70s on my

                      the bare minimum readings and skipping all the lectures, but if you want that A you'll have to put in a lot of effort.</p>

                      I would consider this course to be the most important third year course. This one is all about algorithms, but not just that, <i>efficient</i> algorithms.<br><br>
                      Imagine you had a program that executed in 10 minutes on an input of say, 100 size (arbitrary units). Imagine as you scale the input higher and highier, say to 1,000 and
                      10,000, then your execution time would take significantly longer. Now imagine you could write a more efficient program that executed 100x faster - that's why this course is
                      important. Extremely heavy courseload, its fair share of theory, and a lot of math is involved. I hope you know your big-O notation well!</p><br>

                    <p class="coursetext">
                      Oh boy...this course.<br><br>
                      My friends and I joke about this a lot. We nicknamed it, "The Gatekeeper" since it holds so many people back from graduation. It's less on the difficulty scale, but there's just an
                      insane amount of work, and the thing that sucks a lot, is you feel so demotivated because you can't figure out <i>why</i> you're doing this.<br><br>
                      Let me clarify. This course is about software design - how to structure and design your code properly so it's more efficient, readable, and more. But the thing is, York University
                      insists on using an ancient language called Eiffel. You're going to spend four months programming in this language just to never use it again, is what I've found. That's the reason I
                      personally felt so drained and demotivated - the concepts were important, but you aren't forced to just learn the concepts! You have to learn an entirely new language, which takes away
                      from the <i>primary</i> purpose of this course: to learn software design patterns.<br><br>
                      The material is important. The concepts are important. What you learn is important and will make you a better developer if you know how to apply them. But, it's just poor execution on
                      the school's part. Although, try your hardest in this course to scrape by. At the end of the day, make sure you walk away knowing what design patterns are, the common ones, and how to
                      implement them (in more modern languages too, like Java).</p><br>
                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - insanely difficult course. Not due to material, but the workload. Learning a new language, how to use the Eiffel Studio IDE, and all the theory is tough. Absolutely
                      do not take this course at the same time as EECS3101 or EECS3221, that would be a suicide mission.</p>

                      This is your choice between EECS3215 (Embedded Systems) or EECS3221 (Operating System Fundamentals). Although, you really don't have much of a choice. You're going to end up taking EECS3221.<br><br>
                      Why? By the time you take this course, you'll have all the prerequisites to take EECS3221. You will most likely never have the prerequisites done for EECS3215, because it needs EECS3201, which
                      needs EECS2200...etcetera. Courses you don't have to take, so you most likely never will.<br><br>
                      This course is about operating systems, and is another C course. This course has a pretty tough workload, so I suggest not doing it at the same time as EECS3101 or EECS3311, if it can be helped.</p><br>

                      So, I went with the EECS3421 route (databases). I really enjoyed it, found it extremely useful, and honestly I gained so much value from this course. As soon as this course was over, I went back
                      to a few of my personal projects and revamped them, incorporating them with a database and making them much more sophisicated. If you also take this course, you'll be learning topics like
                      relational algebra, SQL, ER diagrams, and more. Not all professors will cover this, but we went over SQL security and SQL injections, which was a lot of fun!<br><br>
                      Remember you aren't limited to taking only one of these options. You can do more from this list if you wanted. I can't speak on the other courses since I haven't taken them, but I can vouch

                    <p class="coursetext">
                      <strong>tl;dr</strong> - I took EECS3421. Fun and important course to being a developer with a decent workload. Can't speak on the other two courses.</p>

                A lot of people think that what you learn in university will set up you nicely for the rest of your life. This is not the case.<br><br>
                To me, what we learn in university gives us a nice <strong>framework</strong> to what we should learn, but we still need to do a lot of our own independent learning outside of this.
                For example, there aren't any courses on Python and I wanted to learn it - so I did. I wanted to learn how to make a Discord and Twitter bot - so I did. There weren't any courses on it, I just
                starting following guides and tutorials I saw online.<br><br>
                Learning isn't confined to your classrooms. There's a lot to learn that a computer science degree won't cover. It's <i>up to you</i> to learn more outside of your degree requirements, because
                to be honest, <i>just</i> what you learn in school isn't even remotely enough to find a job. Computer science is a constantly evolving field and you need to keep up, and keep learning above
                all else.</p>

                in my head or through the notes app on my phone.<br><br>
                Now, I keep a Google calendar to remind of all my lectures, labs, test, and exam dates. I had a physical notebook I used as a journal to keep tracking my current grades in
                classes, degree progress, and my professors e-mails. I use Discord a lot, so I made my own Discord server where I'm the only member and I use it a <strong>ton</strong> to
                remember important links, write quick reminders, track my degree progress, write down the requirements to courses I need to take in the future, and a lot more.<br><br>
                Please stay on top of your organization. It's an easy way to feel overwhelmed otherwise, having so much to remember and not being able to remember all of it, or knowing you wrote
                something down once and can't remember where you put that piece of paper.</p>

              <strong>Utilize Your Summers</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                I cannot stress this enough: <strong>use your summers wisely</strong>.<br><br>
                I get you want to enjoy your summer after a long and stressful year, but you can make your next year a lot less stressful if you take maybe one or two courses in the summer. Think about it like this -
                you take maybe four, five, or six courses in the year. It's tough, but you manage. Now imagine if you only took one or two courses, and was able to dedicate all your time and effort into those courses.
                You're most likely going to walk away with some high grades.<br><br>
                The standard is to do five courses a semester: so that's five in the fall, and five in the winter. Although, I really don't like this and feel overwhelmed by so many classes, so what I do instead is take
                four in the fall, four in the winter, and <i>two in the summer</i>.<br><br>
                There're lots of pros to taking class in the summer. Want to raise your GPA? Retake a course. Gonna be working relatively close to York over the summer? Take a class. Have an insanely hard class you
                don't want to screw up your year (cough, EECS3101)? Then take it in the summer. Isolate your difficult courses by taking them in the summer, so it doesn't affect the rest of your school year.<br><br>
                Since starting university in September 2017, I have not taken a single summer off. I took a course in the summer of 2018, took two courses and worked at York the next summer, and this summer I'll
                be working full-time and spending a lot of time on my side projects.</p>

              <p class="coursetext">
                Knowing how to manage your time is a pivotal part in being a university student, and in life.<br><br>
                This isn't high school anymore where you take four classes in a day, maybe three if you have a spare. You can be taking upwards of maybe five or six courses at once, and if they all
                have midterms in the same week, or even in the same <i>day</i>, then you better learn how to manage your time wisely.<br><br>
                I remember I used to play Steam games (CS:GO for life) like crazy in high school. Once university hit, I completely had to change my habits because for me, setting into university life was
                hard. It's pretty dangerous getting good grades in high school without having to put in any effort, because those habits carry over.<br><br>
                I ended up uninstalling Steam and fixing my sleeping habits, because it was awful sleeping at 2:00am, getting up for an 8:00am lecture, barely being able to pay attention during it, and
                then having to catch up on everything post-lecture.<br><br>
                If you have any bad habits, like sleeping at 4:00am constantly or playing games for hours and hours, break them immediately.</p>

                I know. You hear this a lot.<br><br>
                Speaking from personal experience though, joining clubs was a pretty big part of getting through university, especially if you're a new student. You get to meet a lot of new people, especially older
                ones that can give you their insight and knowledge. I made friends with this one student two years above me, and he gave me a lot of advice on what professors to avoid, gave me old midterms to study
                from, helped me with my labs, and more. Great way to meet people, who could end up providing a lot of relief in your stressful university life.<br><br>
                I get it, though. You don't know what clubs to join, or you're antisocial, or you can't find anything you're interested in. <i>And that's fine too</i>. You can always meet people other ways, this
                is just one example of it. Although, I find that as you just progress throughout the year, you'll naturally gravitate towards clubs you want to join. I know that when I was a first year student,
                I went to one CSHub event and now in third year, I'm the president of CSHub.</p>

              <p class="coursetext">
                I'm just going to say right now - university is <strong>not</strong> a solo sport.<br><br>
                What does this mean? Go cheat on all your tests and exams? No; it means to establish a good support group. You're bound to see the same people for the next 3-5 years, so you might as well get to know
                them, right? You're bound to study for the same midterms and exam, so might as well get to know them, right?<br><br>
                I can definitely say, I would not be where I am right now without the support of all my friends and everyone I met in computer science. I remember one day walking out of a lecture hall having
                just written a midterm, and I was sitting on a bench waiting for my other friends to come out. I noticed the person sitting beside me had the same shoes as me, so I pointed it out and now he's
                one of my closest friends who has given me a ton of support through the last few years I've known him.<br><br>
                Make friends. If you're antisocial or in an awkward shell, it's time to get out of it. You're going to be a professional in a few years, it's important to know how to establish
                good relations with people, know to talk to one another, and how to make friends.<br><br>
                Your lectures and the computer science channel in the York University Discord server is a great way to start talking to people. Frosh is also a really good opportunity to meet a lot of people in your
                faculty as well. I liked my frosh so much, I ended up being a frosh leader for the next two years as well.</p>

                Basically, co-op and internships means working in the middle of your degree. It's a way to get real, industry working experience as a student.<br><br>
                I'm asked a lot what's the difference between the two is - and in the "real world" there isn't one. It's just an opportunity for a student to get some relevant, real, working
                experience with a company.<br><br>
                Although, to Lassonde, there <strong>is</strong> a difference. The differences are explained in Co-op & Internships --> Lassonde Programs.

              <strong>Why Should You Do Them?</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                Okay. This is gonna be a long one, because I feel <i>very strongly</i> about the topic.<br><br>
                I remember looking around my EECS1012 LAS A lecture room once, and I saw so many people. Then I remember about all the students in other lectures, students in their second, third, and fourth
                years. Then I remembered how many universities we have in Canada. Essentially the point I'm trying to make here is - <strong>there's a lot of damn people you're competing with here</strong>.<br><br>
                I remember talking to my older sister (who was in engineeering) about how are you supposed to <i>stand out</i> from all these people, and she said <strong>work experience</strong>. But, how can you
                get work experience as a new grad if you don't <i>have</i> any to begin with? There's surely a bunch of people more qualified than me, how am I ever going to get noticed? How do people get work
                experience in the first place? It's a catch-22!<br><br>
                The answer: <strong>co-op and internships</strong>.<br><br>
                See, when you graduate and apply for jobs, you're gonna be applying as a <i>new grad</i> and you're gonna be expected to know a lot and perform well. You're being hired based on your ability to perform.
                Although, as an intern, you're being hired based on your ability to perform, but <i>also your ability to grow into someone who can perform</i>.<br><br>
                As a student, I recommend you should be aiming to accomplish as many internships as you can before you graduate. That way when you do graduate, you're gonna be worth a million dollars with how much knowledge and
                work experience you've garnered! In my opinion, the way I like to learn is through doing real, practical work - applying my knowledge in a real environment and <i>not through reading a bunch of slides</i>.<br><br>
                I could honestly go on for hours about the value of getting an internship and work experience in your undergrad, but I think I made my point clear. It's important to stay competitive, and to do so you need
                work experience. But as an undergrad, you don't really know much. So, you do an internship. Then when you graduate, you have a bunch of real, industry knowledge and experience and are a strong competitor.</p>

              <strong>How Do I Get My First?</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                Getting your first is always going to be the hardest. Once you get your first work experience down, you can use that momentum to strengthen your resume and then get your second, third, and fourth
                work experiences. But the question is - how can I go about getting my first one?<br><br>
                This one is hard, and remember that it's largely a game of chance too. I sent out ~200 applications, and got <strong>one</strong> job offer from all those applications when applying to my first
                internship. I would recommend having a strong portfolio of side projects to display on your GitHub, a well-polished LinkedIn, and strong data structure and algorithm skills (practise your LeetCode a lot).<br><br>
                It also obviously helps if you know someone that can get you a referral or can get you an interview at the snap of a finger - again going back to my point about making friends (Miscellaneous --> Making Friends),
                you never know who can provide what for you. Someone I talked to for half an hour in the Bergeron lobby while we were waiting in line ended up giving me a referral to RBC and we're still good friends to this day.<br><br>
                Remember that it <i>is</i> still largely lucked based, so don't feel discouraged if you get nothing after a long and lengthy job hunt. All I have to say is <strong>keep applying</strong>.</p>

              <strong>Lassonde Programs</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                Each have their own respective requirements. More information can be found on their offical website. Here's a quick difference between the two:<br><br>

                Co-op:<br>
                - needs a 5.0 CGPA (meaning overall)<br>
                - starts after you're done your second year in the summer at the earliest (meaning you'll be spending your winter taking courses and applying to jobs at the same time)<br>
                - go out twice in shorter terms (4-8 months), once after your second year, and once again after your third year<br><br>

                Internship:<br>
                - needs a 6.0 MGPA (major GPA - meaning EECS and MATH courses)<br>
                - starts after your third year in the summer at the earliest (meaning you'll spend the winter taking courses and applying as well)<br>
                - go out once for a lengthier time (4-16 months)<br><br>

                To be honest I don't see much of a difference and why Lassonde divides the two, but I digress. Just make sure that at the end of the day, <strong>you graduate having some relevant work experience</strong>.
                Also, if you don't meet the GPA requirements to be in the Lassonde programs, it's not that big of a deal. You can still find internships without doing it through Lassonde's programs.<br><br>

                The benefit of being in a Lassonde program is that they just aggregate a bunch of job postings for you on a job board so you don't have to find them yourself, and there are a few Lassonde exclusive
                job postings as well (so while you could find the job postings on the company websites themselves, there are a few you can't find unless you're in the Lassonde program).</p> <br>

                Finally: is there a benefit to even being in one of the Lassonde programs? Yes, especially if you have no experience. Most companies will want you to be part of an accredited
                co-op or internship program, because they can get tax breaks for their interns. Most Big-N companies won't care about this, but if you have no experience, you'll want to start small before working
                your way up. Being part of a Lassonde program can help a lot in finding your first internship, but you can disregard joining one of the programs if you already have a few internships under your belt.

              <strong>How Do I Find Jobs?</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                I think the mistake a lot of students make on their first job search is thinking they're limited to the Lassonde job portal (which is not substantial whatsoever) or
                searching 'Software Engineer Intern' on LinkedIn. There's two important components when job searching: <strong>when to search, and how</strong>. <br><br>

                For SUMMER internships, postings can open as early as July-August (the prior year). For FALL internships, postings will open around March-April, and for
                WINTER internships, postings will be open around September-October. Summer is a very busy season - most companies hire for summer only, and the ones that hire all year,
                summer has the most headcount. Fall and winter and generally what I call 'dead seasons'. It's possible to get internships for fall and winter, just much harder. <br><br>

                Here's how I apply to jobs: <br><br>
                - I have a long list of some 100-200 tech companies, and around when internship season begins, I'll Google search '{company name} careers', go to their careers page, and apply
                on the company website. Most companies won't be shelling out money to post ads on LinkedIn. They know most people will go to their website to apply, and people do. <br>
                - Depending on the season you're looking for, Google '{season} internships GitHub repo' - there's usually a GitHub repo floating around every season that's updated constantly
                as internship applications open up. A good example is <a class="a-special" href="https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships" target="_blank">this repo</a>. <br>
                - Talk in friend groups. If you have a group of friends and you're all collectively trying to find internships together, make a group chat and post links to new applications
                you just applied to. Your friends might have applied to a posting you missed, and vice versa.

              <strong>The Difference From Honours and Non-Honours?</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                Basically on paper, honours has a lot more requirements and you need to have 120.0 credits instead of 90.0 credits, for the non-honours.<br><br>
                I say that if you have no idea what you want to do with your life in your third year, then take the honours and do your EECS4XXX courses. It'll help you explore more topics and can
                help you decide what you want to do post-grad. If you already have a firm grasp of what you want to do when you graduate and none of the EECS4XXX courses seem to interest you, I wouldn't
                do the honours. Of course, this is <strong>my personal opinion</strong> and there a lot more factors that contribute to this decision, so I would advise talking to the co-op department
                first before jumping the gun on anything.<br><br>
                Although, if you <i>do</i> want to participate in Lassonde's co-op / internship program, you <strong>do</strong> have to be in the honours. Then again, being in their programs is not
                the only way to find a job placement. You can do it by applying outside the school too.<br><br>
                A lot of factor in - but talk to the necessary people to help you make your decision. It's important to note in comparison to other universities, their "normal computer science degree" is
                <i>really</i> our "honours" degree. I know some people get caught up thinking that being in an honours program is "special", but really honours is the "standard" degree; at other schools, their four
                year standard degree is our honours.</p>

                In the art variant you'll take more humanities for your electives, and science variant you'll take more science courses for your electives. Same core courses for both parties.<br><br>
                I can't really say which one is better than the other, but if I <i>had</i> to choose I would lean more towards sciences - I am doing a B.Sc after all, so there might
                be some bias in what I say. The best way I can put this is, if you like arts and humanities, the B.A is for you. If you like science and mathematics, the B.Sc is for you.</p>

                Take courses as needed. There's no need to rush yourself.<br><br>
                I hear this a lot: "I need to take X, Y, Z, I, J, K courses all in the same semester to <strong>catch up</strong>!"<br><br>
                No, you don't. There is no "catching up." Are you in university to get your degree as fast as possible and leave barely knowing the content, or are you in university to actually <i>learn</i>
                and know what you're doing?<br><br>
                In my second year, I was too caught up in this. I wanted to graduate at the same time with my friends - but ultimately taking so many courses at once hurt me a lot more than anything. Pace yourself
                according to your strengths. If you can only manage four courses in a semester, that's fine. If you can only manage three, two, or even one course, <i>that's fine</i>. And it's important you
                know this. Don't let yourself get caught up in what other people are doing.<br><br>
                Alternatively, if you're like me and don't really like learning much through textbooks and lectures and instead by doing, then just get your degree and get out. C's get degrees, am I right?</p>

              <p class="coursetext">
                Okay, so technically, computer science is a four year program. Given you need 120.0 credits, that's 30.0 credits a year, which is 15.0 credits a semester, which is
                about <strong>five</strong> courses a term, considering you take your summers off. If you're in the 90.0 credit program, it's 30.0 credits a year for three years instead of four. You can take
                summer school to accelerate this.<br><br>
                Despite this, there is no "graduating on time" in my opinion. Sure, computer science is a four year degree, right? So you expect to get it done in four year? I've actually met a lot of people
                who did their computer science degree in five or six years, and they ended up being a lot happier because of it. Taking your time and knowing you can't handle a standard amount is perfectly
                fine. Hell, I'll be taking 5-6 years to do my degree because I want to rack up a lot of work experience before I graduate. Though, this is my opinion. My friend actually believes the oppposite;
                instead to get your degree and just get out because experience is king, not your grades (which I can also get behind).<br><br>
                It's like my dad says to me - take your time and be happy. You have the rest of your life ahead of you. Just make sure you don't take 10 years to get your degree - it might not be a race, but you
                shouldn't need 7-8 years for a four year program.</p>

              <strong>Is York a Good School for Computer Science?</strong><br>
              <p class="coursetext">
                To me, any school is a good school for computer science if they have a good co-op / internship program. If you asked me which is the <i>best</i> school for computer science, I would think that
                Waterloo is <i>the</i> school for computer science because of how masterful their computer science program is - graduating in five years with ~24 months of experience. How? Because between each
                of their years (first to second, second to third) they make good use of the summers, whether it's for taking classes or using it for co-op.<br><br>
                I used to think that was awful, five straight years of school with no break - but it's not. It's class for about 8 months to a year, then a break for co-op, then back to school. It's a great
                system they got there, but there's no reason you can't do the same at York. During the summers, just make sure you're using them efficiently whether you decide to find a job or take classes
                (Miscellaneous & General Tips --> Utilize Your Summers).<br><br>
                I do think York is lacking in some departments, I wish some courses were taught differently (EECS3311) but honestly, I'm <strong>very</strong> happy with my decision to study here - you make the most
                out of it. If you do just the bare minimum to get your degree and leave you probably won't have the best time. However, I'm very involved in the community, and I love all the friends I've made
                and feel such a strong sense of camaraderie here.</p>

              <strong>How Much Math Is in Computer Science?</strong><br>
              I asked myself the same thing in high school and when I was a first year student because I was awful at advanced functions and calculus. Truth be told, "computer science math" is not the same as
              advanced functions and calculus, and I say this sparingly. I find myself programming more logically than I do mathematically, if that makes sense.<br><br>
              In the degree itself, yes you'll have your fair share of math classes (EECS1019, MATH1090, MATH1300, MATH1310, MATH2030) but after they're done, they're done. I haven't found myself using anything
              I learned in calculus I or calculus II, but discrete mathematics? Definitely.<br><br>
              Again, I say this sparingly for lack of better word, but "computer science math" is really more logical based and less calculations based. If you hate calculus, you just need to truck through it
              and then you're free.

              <p class="coursetext">
                If you're asking this question, it's because you're almost at the end of your degree and noticed you can't take another 3.0 credit course without going over the 90.0 / 120.0 threshold.<br><br>
                Let's first remember how we got here - majority of the courses you take are either 3.0 or 6.0 credits - numbers that are divisble by 3.0. Since 90.0 / 120.0 are also divisble by 3.0, it works out!
                Although, we had to take EECS1001 which is 1.0 credit (so now we're "offset" by one) and also EECS2021 which is 4.0 credits (so now we're "offset" by two).<br><br>
                But basically - <strong>no</strong> you can't. You're either going to have to find another course to fix your offset (meaning restoring your credit count to a number that is divisible by 3.0 again) or just
                take another course and you'll be pushed past the required credit total and end up graduating with 92.0 or 122.0 credits. Perfectly fine, but a waste of money if you would prefer to end on a perfect
                90.0 or 120.0.</p>

                The reason I made this guide is because many people would reach out to me with a lot of common questions, so I wanted to put this website together as a way to address them,
                to document everything I've learned over the years, and things I wish I knew when I was a first year student. I was inspired when I saw students from other universities
                making guides like this, so I wanted to do the same. If there are any inconsistencies, something outdated, or want a topic added, then feel free to message me on Discord;

                A condensed version is below. <br><br>

                - Graduated from high school June 2017. I had no idea what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I knew I liked computers, so I ran with that. I aced all my chemsitry
                classes in high school, so I went with that too. I applied to digital media and chemistry at York, and computer science at York, Waterloo and Ryerson. I got into everything
                except Waterloo; I got deferred to geomatics. I went to York for computer science. <br><br>
                - Started computer science in September 2017. I've said it before and I'll say it again - computer science isn't a kind major to those not deeply passionate about it. I got
                my ass handed to me in first year, and was struggling in first year courses like EECS1019, EECS1022, and MATH1310. I dropped two courses in my first year, and felt really
                defeated about it. If everyone else could do it, why couldn't I? I talked to a Lassonde academic advisor about getting advice, and they suggested I switch majors. I stayed in. <br><br>
                - Made it through my first year, fall 2017 and winter 2018. I took summer school courses to catch up on the ones I dropped winter semester. Would've been more productive to
                look for internships instead, but I had no idea what internships were. No one told me. I had no idea how to advance my career, so I did class instead. <br><br>
                - Second year was more kind to me since I got better at time management and how to optimize my schedule. Having a good group of friends to rely on when I need help was also
                great. I got through fall 2018 and winter 2019 just fine, but winter 2019 was the first time I learned about the Lassonde internship program, and that it needed a 6.0 GPA to enter.
                I had a 4.6. That summer 2019, I retook 3 courses, converted 3 Ds to 3 As, and brought my GPA up to a 6.1. <br><br>
                - Third year was an important one. I went to Hack the North 2019, and it really opened my eyes. I got to talk to a lot of students who told me about their internships at Google,
                Facebook, Amazon, etc. (albeit at the time they were probably just bragging, but to me it was humbling) and I realized I also wanted to do the same. I finally got my head out of my
                ass and I told myself that summer, I'd get my first internship. <br><br>
                - Being a student and looking for internships is not easy. In between juggling 5 classes, trying to LeetCode, do side projects, and apply to jobs was really hard. Seeing all my other
                friends get interviews and job offers while I didn't was hard. Me failing the few interviews I had was hard. I was getting pretty miserable and depressed, but last minute I was able
                to clutch an OA from CaseWare, got an interview, and converted it to an 8 month long internship offer. I got my first internship! <br><br>
                - I lost my first internship. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, CaseWare had to let go half of its interns. I was in the unlucky half. Back to applying. <br><br>
                - I saw this one posting for the 'MLH Fellowship' program, which was an Open Source Software development internship catered towards students who lost their internship to COVID-19.
                I applied and got it. <br><br>
                - Finished my third year (fall 2019, winter 2020) and did my first internship at the MLH Fellowship that summer 2020. A few months into this internship, CaseWare emailed me asking
                if I was interested in joining them in September. I said yes. <br><br>
                - After finishing my internship at the MLH Fellowship, I went to CaseWare. During my time at CaseWare, I kept applying to jobs because I wasn't ready to go back to school, and I wanted
                to intern somewhere else for winter 2021 (two 4 month internships > one 8 month internship). I got an offer at MDA Space for winter 2021. <br><br>
                - After CaseWare, I went to work at MDA Space. During my internship, I still kept applying. I got an internship offer at Amazon for summer 2021, and also got a Shopify offer
                for summer 2021. I managed to defer Shopify to fall 2021, though. I also decided that I no longer want to do the 120 credit degree, and will do the 90 credit degree instead.
                I had all the job experience in the world, getting a full time job offer after I graduate shouldn't be too hard (I hope), despite me not having the 'honours' degree. <br><br>
                - That brings us to present day. It's currently April 16th, 2021 (middle of winter 2021 semester if you will). I'm currently still working at MDA Space, but will be going to Amazon
                this summer and will go to Shopify this fall. After the fall, I think I'll finally go back to school and do my last courses and graduate. Will update this as the timeline unfolds.
