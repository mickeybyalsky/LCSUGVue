              <p class="coursetext">
                I feel like sharing my university career will be beneficial because I did not have a very conventional path. I decided midway through my degree that I wanted to drop from the honours program, I took
                about 20 months off of school to do five internship back to back to back to back to back, and overall it was just...different than how most people do university. I just want to show whoever is reading
                this that you don't have to approach university how you 'think' it should be done -- things changes, everyone's situation is unique, and more. For context, I graduated from high school June 2017 and
                had no idea what I wanted to study in university. I knew that I was expected to go to university by my family (and I guess it's just the 'assumption' or 'generic' route people take after graduating high
                school) and I originally thought about majoring in chemistry since it's what I excelled at in high school. My high school didn't offer computer science courses at the time so I never even really got
                to explore if computer science was my thing or not. I applied to chemistry, but on a whim I decided to apply to computer science as well since I was always interested in technology and I had early
                exposure to computers...so why not? I got accepted into computer science, never wrote a single line of code before, had no idea what it was about, but I just felt like it was right for me so I accepted
                my offer to study computer science at York University, and started September 2017. So, here's basically the last four years of my life. Note, this will be really long. <br> <br>

                <ul>
                  <li> <strong>Fall 2017:</strong> took EECS1001, EECS1012, MATH1300, CHEM1000, POLS1000. I was just getting adjusted to university life. Made a few friends (who I'm still friends with to this day -- hi Leo and Dan),
                    and focused mainly on school. I breezed through high school without having to study, so the change of environment was hard. I ended this semester with a Pass, A, C+, and A. POLS was year long. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Winter 2018:</strong> took EECS1019, EECS1022, MATH1310, CHEM1001, POLS1000. This was a really hard semester since I had the misfortunate of grouping really hard courses together, and having the worst
                    professor in each of the classes without realizing it. I ended up having to drop MATH1310 and CHEM1001. I remember I went to one of the Lassonde academic advisors to ask for advice and the person I talked to
                    suggested that I drop out of computer science, and that chemistry was better for me since I had an A in CHEM1000 and got a D+ in EECS1019. I actually almost did, but I stayed in out of spite. I ended this semester
                    with a D+, C, dropped, dropped, and B+. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Summer 2018:</strong> you know how in high school when it's summer break, you get to enjoy your life for a few months before school starts again? I was thinking that's also how it worked in university, so I
                    didn't make this summer too productive (which is an error my part, more on that later). I decided to take one course though, CHEM1001, and got an A. I also got my G2 license this summer, which was cool. </li> <br> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Fall 2018:</strong> second year, cool. Had an enjoyable first year, couldn't complain. I was behind a bit though, I should've taken MATH1310 but I didn't. I took EECS2001, EECS2030, MATH1310, MATH1090,
                    and MODR1770. Got my ass kicked in MATH1310 again, so I dropped it again. Rest of the courses were fine, and ended the semester with a C+, B, dropped, B, and MODR was year long. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Winter 2019:</strong> probably my hardest semester. I felt really behind all my peers in computer science classes, I couldn't 'get' concepts as fast as other people who were programming since high school, and
                    overall this semester was really bad for my mental. I took EECS2011, EECS2021, EECS2031, and MODR1770. I got a D, A, D+, and A respectively, but those two Ds put me really close to academic probation (4.6 GPA). </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Summer 2019:</strong> winter semester was pretty depressing and dropped my GPA significantly. When summer came I decided to stop moping about it and get my shit together, so I took bought an online Python course
                    so I could learn how to code better, spent the summer writing a few personal projects and putting them on my GitHub, and I retook three courses this summer: EECS1019, EECS2011, and MATH1300. I also took HUMA2200, public
                    speaking, which actually ended up being my favourite course and one that taught me a lot. I turned a 2 Ds and a C to 2 As and a B+ that summer, and got an A in HUMA2200.  I made a lot of new friends in my summer courses,
                    worked a part time student IT job where I made even more friends, and overall it was an awesome and productive summer where I grew and matured a lot. I raised my GPA from a 4.6 to a 6.1, which was just barely high enough to
                    admit me into the Lassonde internship program (needed a 6.0 minimum). </li> <br> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Fall 2019:</strong> starting third year now. Took EECS3000, EECS3311, EECS3421, and ANTH3040. EECS3311 was a nightmare and dropped it. I got a C, dropped, B+, and ANTH was year long. I also went to my first
                    hackathon this semester, Hack the North 2019. This is the largest hackathon in Canada, and it takes place at the University of Waterloo. So far up to this point, I had no relevant job experience. I didn't know a thing about
                    co-ops or internships, but when I got to Hack the North it opened my eyes. In my group, there was a bunch of Waterloo students who were talking about they just finished their summer internship at Google, Microsoft, Facebook,
                    and more. I'm pretty sure at the time they were just flexing on me, but it really inspired me because I didn't know students can take time from school and go work at these large tech companies. I vowed to get my first internship
                    that summer, so I joined the Lassonde internship program. I registered, went to all their workshops, and got access to their job portal. Applied to around 75 places this fall, no responses except from IBM, which I failed the OA.
                    Tough shit. I didn't know what "LeetCode" was or what an "OA" was, I didn't have anyone to guide me through this, since honestly, all my classmates were in the same boat. We all knew getting job experience was important but
                    how do we prepare? How do we study and get better? We were all trying to figure it out together. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Winter 2020:</strong> nightmare semester. I took EECS3311, EECS3482, ENG1600, and ANTH3040. Relatively light courseload, but trying to juggle applying to internships, doing LeetCode to practise, making side projects
                    to slap on your resume and get noticed - it was really overwhelming. Navigating recruitment season is so hard, especially if you're doing it blind and without guidance. I sent maybe 200 applications and heard nothing back. All the
                    jobs I applied to on the Lassonde portal was doing nothing for me. I got my resume reviewed by one of the Lassonde academic advisors 3-4 times and even they were baffled why I wasn't hearing anything back. I was applying viciously
                    all of January, February, and March...and it wasn't until the end of March I got an email from CaseWare asking me to take their OA. I took the OA, got invited to an interview. I was scared. I was praying. I took the interview a week
                    after the OA, and I did really well. 10 minutes after I left the CaseWare office, I got an email saying they'd like to extend me a software engineer internship that summer. Fuck it, goal was completed, all that blood, sweat, and tears
                    (literal tears - I actually did have break downs from the stress) was worth it! I was able to focus on school for the rest of the semester and ended with a B+, A, Pass, and B+. Oh also, this was when the COVID-19 pandemic started
                    picking up. Around April, school and exams went remote. It was a pretty nice break, and made for easy exams. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Summer 2020:</strong> so, this was the summer I was supposed to be doing my first internship at CaseWare, right? Well, because of COVID-19, half the interns they extended offers to got their offer rescinded...which I was
                    one of. You know why this was especially shitty? I got the email saying they were rescinding my offer two weeks before I was supposed to begin, giving me no time to find another internship, and I actually /declined/ interviews at
                    other companies because I had already signed an offer at CaseWare. Things were looking pretty grim, but there was this program I saw advertised around called the MLH Fellowship by Major League Hacking. It was an internship where you
                    work on open source software, and it was oriented towards students who lost their job because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I applied, got an interview, passed it, and I got this internship miraculously last minute. In the middle of this
                    internship, CaseWare reached out to me asking if I wanted to intern with them during the fall, and I said okay. I signed an 8 month contract, so I'd be with them the upcoming fall and upcoming winter semesters. </li> <br> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Fall 2020:</strong> my fourth year. I took time off school to be interning with CaseWare, since I wanted more work experience. I was on a frontend team and I hate frontend, so I wasn't particularly enjoying my time
                    working here. While interning here I kept applying to more internships, and I got a job at MDA Space for the winter semester...so I told CaseWare I'd be breaking my contract and leaving the company early. They were okay with it,
                    they understood, but Lassonde was very upset with me, saying I was unprofessional and ruining the school's reputation with the comapany. Call me selfish, but I didn't really care. I was just looking out for myself and what was
                    best for me. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Winter 2021:</strong> I moved to Halifax with one of my friends who also got the job at MDA Space, and we lived together. It was a fun time. I wasn't content with CaseWare and MDA Space on my resume, though. I wanted
                    bigger names. Back in November I got an invitation from Amazon to take their OA. I did 5-6 hours of LeetCode a day, followed a bunch of subreddits for CS majors, and connected with a bunch of people and joined many online communities.
                    This was the point in time I found the 'CS Majors' and 'cscareers.dev' Discord servers, staples of any CS student. It did affect my performance at work, but I was doing LeetCode religiously everyday because I had an interview
                    in February after passing Amazon's three stage OA. I took the interview and passed, so now I was en route to working at Amazon in the summer. Around March, I got an interview with Shopify, and I ended up getting the job offer as
                    well for the summer...but I already signed an offer with Amazon. Not wanting to pass up the opportunity, I asked if the offer could be moved to the fall semester, and they said yes. Now I was also en route to working at Shopify
                    in the fall - this would be my 5th internship in a row now. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Summer 2021:</strong> I worked at Amazon, and finally took MATH1014. I got a C+. I worked remotely from home for Amazon since COVID-19 was still fucking shit up, but I did take a one week trip to Vancouver to hang out with
                    my friends who were working there. I met a bunch of other interns (not just from Amazon, but also LinkedIn and Microsoft!) and had a really good time. We went to the beach and went drinking every other day. It made me really sad I didn't
                    choose to work hybrid, since Amazon gave the option of that or to work fully remote. After taking that trip to Vancouver, I really wish I worked over there instead. Oh well. </li> <br> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Fall 2021:</strong> start of my fifth year. At this point in time I already decided I'd drop from the 4 year honours program to the 3 year regular program, so I've effectively taking 5 years now and I still don't have
                    my degree for what's supposed to be a 3 year program. I think I definitely took too many internships, but with each recruiting season I went through I ended up learning a lot, making new connections, and expanding my network. I worked
                    at Shoipfy and had a good time. It was also remote which sucked, but oh well. At this point in time, I was 75.0 / 90.0 credits done for my degree, so I just needed 5 more until I graduate. I did end up applying to jobs again during my
                    Shopify term, but this time to both new grad and internship roles. The idea was that I'd apply to new grad roles at some companies, but other companies I applied to internship roles, because their new grad interviews were much harder
                    and I could 'game' the system a bit. See, a new grad interview cycle at Facebook is ~5 stages. An intern interview cycle is 2 stages. So, if you want to new grad at Facebook, you can intern there first, and get a new grad return offer
                    if your team likes you, and skip over new grad interviews if you don't feel confident in your skills to pass them. Speaking of Facebook, I applied and got an offer to intern there next summer, woohoo. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Winter 2022:</strong> taking my final courses this semester, EECS3101, EECS3221, PHYS1470, and STS3600. Technically done my degree by the end of this semester, all 90.0 / 90.0 credits. I won't be taking my convocation
                    ceremony in June though, I'm going to delay it to October. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Summer 2022:</strong> I'll be at Facebook. Hopefully if COVID-19 calms down a bit (currently omicron is fucking the world up right now) I'll be living in Seattle. </li> <br>
                  <li> <strong>Fall 2022:</strong> done my sixth and last internship at Facebook. Hopefully have a new grad return offer. Will be recruiting for new grad around this point in time, since I want to start new grad January 2023. </li> <br> <br>
                  <li> <strong>TL;DR:</strong> F17 school -> W18 school -> S18 school -> F18 school -> W19 school -> S19 school -> F19 school -> W20 school -> S20 MLH Fellowship + TAing for EECS1012 -> F20 CaseWare -> W21 MDA Space -> S21 Amazon
                    -> F21 Shopify -> W22 last school semester -> S22 Facebook -> F22 convocation in October + applying to new grad jobs -> W23 aiming to start my new grad job January 2023. September 2017 - October 2022. What a wild ride. </li>
